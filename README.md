# Handshake Development Environment
This repository is an environment to experiment with the Handshake API and develop solutions for the Post-Graduate Planning Office at Olin College. If you are from another institution, feel free to use this repository as a resource in your own development.

### How to use

##### Requirements
This project makes use of the Python requests library. If this library is not already on you computer, you will have to execute this command in the terminal:
`pip install requests`

##### Running source code
Currently, there is not enough code to use this repository to do useful work.

### How to contribute
If you are familiar with the Handshake API, RESTful architecture, and JSON, feel free to dive right in and start working! If you are an Olin student working with the office of Post-Graduate Planning and would like access to the API key, or to be added as a collaborator on this repository, please email me at awenstrup@olin.edu.

If any of this is new to you (as it all was to me at the time I created this project), feel free to check out the resources below that I used to learn about development for the Handshake API.
